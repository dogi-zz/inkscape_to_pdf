## Create Multi-Page PDFs from inkscape-SVGs

In Order to Export your Inkscape Drawings, you can mark some groups in your 
Drawing with 'page_X', and this tool will create a PDF with each of this
groups as pages.

To be able to have your pages side by side in your drawing, the transform
property will be removed during teh export. So you must create the group
while the content is on the page.
